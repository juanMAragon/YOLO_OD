## About <a name = "about"></a>

YOLO is a family of compound-scaled object detection models trained on the COCO dataset, and includes simple functionality for Test Time Augmentation (TTA), model ensembling, hyperparameter evolution, and export to ONNX, CoreML and TFLite.

Through this repository you will find some projects of my own developed using the YOLO object detection models.
